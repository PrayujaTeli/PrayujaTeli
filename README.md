##ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Prayuja Teli, 

A passionate computer science graduate student at Drexel University in Philadelphia. With a knack for problem-solving and a love for technology, I'm on a mission to make a difference in the world through my work. My journey in software engineering began at Krishagni Solutions Pvt Ltd, where I honed my skills in Java, JavaScript, and more. From developing innovative solutions like the OpenSpecimen Android Application to configuring healthcare research projects for breast cancer and COVID-19 studies, I've had the opportunity to make a real impact. At eClerx Pvt Ltd, I furthered my expertise in database design and analysis, contributing to improved customer satisfaction and efficiency. When I'm not coding, you'll find me working on exciting personal projects like the DMS Android Application or diving into the world of IoT with my Automated Switch System. With a strong foundation in both technical skills and practical experience, I'm ready to take on new challenges and continue making a positive mark in the tech industry.
